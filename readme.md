<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
<h3>Outline</h3>
<p>For this assignment used my code for assignment 1 as a base and then added several features</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Integrated the project my own Api instead of querying the TMDB Api as in Assignment 1</li>
  <li>Seeded Data for people Objects as well as movies</li>
  <li>Created Mongoose schema for, Movies, People and Users</li>
  <li>Added queries for all data types, with some of those protected queries, requiring a BEARER token</li>
  <li>Added authentication with Private Routes to the App</li>
  <li>Created 3 Movie Pages, first a regular discover page, second a page sorted by release date and
  third a page sorted by ranking</li>
  <li>Created 2 People Pages, a regular discover page and a page sorted by vote average</li>
  <li>I also added detail Pages for both Movie and Person Details Pages, both of which use my original API</li>
  <li>Several Button components to: Add a favourite Movie, Add to the users Watch List, Follow a person and Unfollow them</li>
  </ul>
